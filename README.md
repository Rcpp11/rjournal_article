C++ 11 article
=============

Article for the R journal about C++11 and beyond. 

The article will:
 - give a few hints about why we want c++11. For example, auto, list initializer and range based for loops 
   are game changers in terms of how you write c++ code. Those are simple concepts easy to grasp by the 
   lambda Rcpp user. Once you start to use them it is hard to look back. I might also mention lambda functions. 
 - introduce [Rcpp11](https://github.com/romainfrancois/Rcpp11), a reboot of Rcpp targerting C++11. 
 - mention known compilers that support c++11. clang and gcc are feature complete. 
 - extend the view on the future of C++. A new standard is likely to be published in 2014 and it
   is likely that compilers will support it upfront. C++17 will also bring interesting possibilities.
