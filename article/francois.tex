\section{Introduction}

Extending R with compiled code is a great way to achieve good performance. 
Using C++ to rewrite critical parts has become a popular approach
in R package development. 

With the release of long awaited C++11 standard~\citep{Cpp11}, 
the C++ Standards Commitee has changed the meaning of C++, making it 
a language that is nicer to use and teach. 

This article has two goals, 
showing a few examples of C++11 language features that might be 
relevant to R package development, and introducing
Rcpp11, a complete C++11 redesign of \CRANpkg{Rcpp}. 

This section presents a few features of C++11 which might be 
relevant to R package developpers using C++. For a complete 
reference of C++11, see~\citep{Stroustrup2013}.

\section{leitmotiv}

We will use a simple leitmotiv to show various features of C++11: counting 
the number of positive values from a numeric vector. We can easily express
this as a simple R function:

\begin{example}
count_positive <- function(x){
  sum(x > 0)
}
\end{example}

We could rewrite this example in C++ using any implementation of the 
\CRANpkg{Rcpp} api with a simple \code{for} loop: 

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  int res = 0 ;
  for( int i=0; i<x.size(); i++){
    if( x[i] > 0.0 ) res++ ;
  }
  return res ;
}
\end{example}

\section{Range based for loops}

The previous code chunk uses a typical C++ \code{for} loop, directly 
inherited from C. C++11 introduces range based for loops, which have 
closer semantics to the loop we would use in R. We can revisit the 
example using a range based for loop:

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  int res = 0 ;
  for( double d: x){
    if( d > 0 ) res++ ;
  }
  return res ;
}
\end{example}

This is possible because the \code{NumericVector} class implements 
the range concept with \code{begin} and \code{end} member functions. 

\section{Lambda functions}

Given \code{NumericVector} implements the range concept, a more C++ idiomatic
way of approaching the problem is to use an algorithm from the Standard
Template Library. The \code{count\_if} that was introduced
in C++11 algorithm is a natural fit, \code{count\_if} iterates through a vector
and counts the number of times the specified predicate is true. 

Before C++11, we would express the predicate using a named function that is defined
elsewhere: 

\begin{example}
inline bool is_positive(double x){
  return x > 0.0 ;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return std::count_if( begin(x), end(x), is_positive ) ;
}
\end{example}

We can also use a compatible callable object to capture some context. The 
following chunk uses the \code{is\_greater} class to capture both the 
intended comparison with a carefully selected name and the threshold (0.0) ;

\begin{example}
class is_greater {
public:
  is_greater( double threshold_) : threshold(threshold_){}
  
  inline bool operator()(double x){
    return x > threshold ;
  }
  
private:
  double threshold ;
}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return std::count_if( x.begin(), x.end(), is_greater(0.0) ) ;
}
\end{example}

With lambdas, C++11 offers a much nicer way to define the predicate, right at the 
call place. Lambdas make the STL much more useful as it eliminates 
many boiler plate code that was previously needed:

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return std::count_if( x.begin(), x.end(), 
    [](double d){ return d > 0 ;}
  ) ;
}
\end{example}

The syntax might look strange and terse at first sight, but conceptually 
using lambda functions in C++ is very similar to what typical R users
would do with the apply family of functions. The ability to define 
functions right at the call site is what was dramatically missing in order
to make the standard template library as useful as it can be. 

\section{Concurrency}

As described by \citep{sutter2005}, the performance free lunch is over. Processors
are no longer getting much faster. It is however becoming 
increasingly common that machines are equiped with multiple core processors, or
even multiple processors. In order to make the most of these
capabilities, software must use the available hardware concurrency. 

Concurrency is not a new thing, C++ programmers have been writing concurrent
code for some time, what is new with C++11 is that concurrency 
is officially supported by the standard. Where you previoulsy 
would have needed to use platform specific facilities 
third party abstractions built around them, you can now take advantage
of threads, mutexes, futures and promises offered by the C++ standard 
library. It makes quite a big difference for developping 
R packages that ought to be distributed to repositories targetting 
multiple plaforms, such as CRAN. 

Writing concurrent code is more work, debugging it is more difficult as we need
to watch for new sources of problems such as race conditions and deadlocks. But 
if we are careful enough and only use concurrency in the right place, it can 
have a great impact on performance, an impact that will scale with the
hardware capabilities. 

Let's factor out the body of the function used in the previous code chunk
into a function operating on a range (\code{count\_positive\_range}), 
and rewrite the \code{count\_positive} function in terms of 
\code{count\_positive\_range}

\begin{example}
typedef NumericVector::iterator Iterator ;

inline int count_positive_range(Iterator begin, Iterator end){
  return std::count_if( begin, end, 
    [](double d){ return d > 0 ;}
  ) ;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return count_positive_range( x.begin(), x.end() ) ;
}
\end{example}

Thanks to inlining, both implementations are identical. The benefit of 
this abstraction is that \code{count\_positive\_range} could now 
operate on a smaller range. As it simplest we could count the 
number of positives on the first half of the data and add it to 
the count of positives from the second half. 

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  int n = x.size() ;
  Iterator start  = x.begin() ;
  int first_half  = count_positive_range(start, start+n/2) ;
  int second_half = count_positive_range(start+n/2, x.end() ) ;
  
  return first_half + second_half ; 
}
\end{example}

This of course does not take advantage of threading as the second 
calculation has to wait for the first one to finish. Writing concurrent 
code is about running these two (and potentially more up to the available
hardware concurrency) tasks in parallel in separate threads. 
This section is not meant as a full reference on threading techniques
or coverage of the facilities of the standard library for writing 
concurrent code as can be found in \citep{williams2012} or the 
relevant chapters of \citep{Stroustrup2013}.

Here is an initial implementation using a separate thread to process
the first half of the data while the main thread process the remaining: 

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive_2threads(NumericVector x){
  int n = x.size() ;
  Iterator it = x.begin() ;
                                         
  std::packaged_task<int(Iterator,Iterator)> task( &count_positive_range ) ;
  std::future<int> first_half = task.get_future() ;
  std::thread t( std::move(task), it, it+n/2 ) ;            
  
  int second_half = count_positive_range(it+n/2, x.end() ) ;
  t.join() ;
  
  return first_half.get() + second_half ;
}
\end{example}

A \code{thread} itself does not return a value, so here we use it in conjunction
with a \code{packaged\_task}, which gives us a way of getting hold of the result, 
as a \code{future}. In this chunk the main thread counts the positive
values in the second half of the data while the thread \code{t} is counting the 
number of positives in the first half of the data. When the main thread has finished
its own work, we \code{join} the worker thread, this blocks the main thread until
the worker thread has finished, so that the value associated with the
future can correctly be retrieved. 

Advanced thread management techniques are outside the scope of this 
article. Let's however generalize the previous chunk by splitting the work 
into several threads. We can simply use a vector of threads to run the smaller
tasks and collect the results with a vector of futures. 

\begin{example}
typedef std::packaged_task<int(Iterator,Iterator)> Task ;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive_threaded(NumericVector data, int nthreads){
  int n = data.size() ;
  int chunk_size = n / nthreads ; 
  
  std::vector<std::future<int>> futures(nthreads-1) ;
  std::vector<std::thread> threads(nthreads-1) ;
  
  Iterator it = data.begin() ;
  for( int i=0; i<nthreads-1; i++){
    count_positive counter ;        
    Task task(counter) ;
    futures[i] = task.get_future();
    threads[i] = std::thread( std::move(task), it, it + chunk_size ) ;
    it += chunk_size ;
  }
  
  int result = count_positive()(it, data.end()); 
  
  for( int i=0; i<nthreads-1; i++){
    threads[i].join() ;
    result += futures[i].get() ;  
  }
                            
  return result ;
}
\end{example}

Concurrency as its cost. First of all the code is more complicated
to write, to understand and to debug. We also must not assume that 
running $N$ jobs in parallel will improve the performance by a factor 
of $N$. Table~\ref{table:count} presents some benchmarks with various 
data sizes (from $10^5$ to $ 10^9$) and various number of threads. 
On the machine used when writing this article, 
the \code{std::thread::hardware\_concurrency} function hints that 8 threads
are supported. 
           
Timings of the pure R function correctly reflect typical issues of 
vectorisation, the R version has to first allocate a logical vector
as big as the input data to host the result of the comparison \code{x>0}, before
starting counting the positives in that logical vector. Allocating 
memory takes time, and increases the chances of triggering garbage collection, 
which also takes time. 

The serial C++ version is a massive improvement over the R version. Further 
improvement is given with multithreaded code. The timings also illustrate 
the inherent cost of threads. When the data size is too small, using threads
actually degrades the whole performance. Arguably the problem used here
is quite simple, and different problem will exhibit different gains 
induced by using threads. There is no universal rule for how to split
the work between threads, and the usual advice of actually measuring 
run time instead of relying on educated guesses stands with thread code, more than 
ever.

unordered maps and sets. were available in TR1, which used to be a pain. is it there, is it not there ...

\section{Rcpp11}

Complete redesign of Rcpp. 
Header only. Assumes C++11.
Much smaller (elimininated lots of code bloat). 
Cleaner (got rid of some ghosts). 
Threaded sugar. 

\section{Beyond C++11}

During development, C++11 was called C++0x in the hope that it would have been 
released some time before 2010. The changes from previous versions of C++
were important, therefore it could only be released officially in 2011. People
often say that C++11 is indeed C++0x in hexadecimal (with $x$ equal to $b$). 

However, the pace of the C++ standards has dramatically increased. A new version
of the standard is expected in 2014, and is likely to be backed by at least 
two major compiler suites (gcc and clang) the same year. C++14 is expected to
be a minor bug fix release. 

The next major release is currently schedule for 2017. For this major 
update of the standard, the commitee has split the work into several 
working groups, e.g. Core, Evolution, Concurrency, Modules, Reflection, to name
a few. 

Although we had to wait until 2013 to see compiler fully support C++11, and
R 3.1.0 for explicit support for packages using C++11 code, things are likely 
to move faster for upcoming versions of the C++ Standard. 

\section{Conclusion}

With a simple example, this article reviewed a few features from
the C++11 standard through the lence of habits and needs of R programmers. 
Conceptually simple features such as range based for loops and lambda functions
make C++ a language closer to R. This article also scratched the surface
of multi-threaded code using built in support from the standard library. 

C++11 is still somewhat new, and it can be argued that not every platform
where R is expected to be used has access to a decent C++11 compiler. Therefore
for a package developper choosing C++11 now might entice some sacrifices. There is a 
choice to be made between using a nicer language that will enable us to write
better software or conservatively stay with C++98 which is 
almost universally available accross the plaform known to be supported by R. 
While moving to C++11 comes with friction from platforms that are not equiped
with the correct tools, I would argue that staying 
with C++98 also comes at a price. Indeed when starting to develop non trivial 
code, we quickly want to use platform specific facilities or 
third party libraries. With the addition of features such threading, hash maps and lambda
functions into the standard, C++11 is a breath of fresh air. Let's breathe.
