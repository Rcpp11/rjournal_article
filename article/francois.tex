\abstract{
  The success of \CRANpkg{Rcpp}~\citep{CRAN:Rcpp} for extending R
  with packages shipping C++ code is indisputable. \CRANpkg{Rcpp} has
  shaped the landscape of performance code for statistical software
  distributed by means of R packages. In 2011, the C++ Standards
  committee has finally released the C++11
  standard~\citep{Cpp11} and in 2013 several vendors have
  delivered full featured versions of their compiler suite.
  C++11 redefines what it means to write C++ code, it is simpler to use, more efficient,
  more concise and more comprehensive than previous versions of the
  standard. This article is an example based walkthrough of some of the features
  of C++11 that might be relevant to R users and developers of
  R packages that use C++ code. This also introduces the
  \CRANpkg{Rcpp11} package, a complete C++11-centric rewrite of \CRANpkg{Rcpp}.

\section{Introduction}

Extending R with compiled code is a great way to achieve good performance.
Using C++ to rewrite critical parts has become a popular approach
in R package development, mainly thanks to facilities
provided by the Rcpp C++ library initially distributed as the
\CRANpkg{Rcpp} package. The \code{Rcpp}
library\footnote{I do mean \emph{library} here -- not \emph{package} --
and throughout this paper, \code{Rcpp} will refer
to the C++ library that is contained in various implementations,
such as \CRANpkg{Rcpp}, \CRANpkg{Rcpp98} or \CRANpkg{Rcpp11}. }
contains classes and various facilities that streamlines
production of packages using C++ code, vastly improving the experience
that otherwise involves using arcane macros and C functions of the
internal R API.

As much as I'm willing to praise the merits of the \code{Rcpp} library, and
as much as I am obviously biased about it,
one of the key thing it brings does not come from the code itself, but from
the incentive of using C++ to express ideas. With its multi-paradigm
nature, C++ is a great vessel, and it just got better with the release of the
new\footnote{The term \emph{new} used is can be misleading as
C++11 was actually released two years before this article. C++11 is however
only newly available to regular C++ programmers using compilers of their
platform of choice.} C++11 standard~\citep{Cpp11}. C++11 is many things, a puzzle
made of many pieces that all fit together, it almost feels like a new language,
and however it is almost entirely backward compatible, you will quickly get in the
habit of writing code using C++11 and will likely find it difficult to
look back. This article highlights a few features of C++11, through a simple
enough leitmotiv example. Full coverage of the added features in
C++11 is beyond the scope here, the reader might refer to~\citep{Stroustrup2013}
for a comprehensive description of C++, as a whole, not necessarily a review
of the added features of C++11.

Finally, this paper gives a quick introduction to \CRANpkg{Rcpp11},
a complete C++11 centric redesign of \CRANpkg{Rcpp}. \CRANpkg{Rcpp11} will
provide solid foundations for extending R with C++11 code for years to come.
The obvious enquiry of \emph{why do this in a new package rather than just
update Rcpp} will be discussed in the relevant section.

\section{leitmotiv}

Consider the simple problem of counting the number of positive values
from a numeric vector. We will use this problem as a leitmotiv for the
article, gradually introducing C++11 features.
We can easily express this as a straightforward R function:

\begin{example}
count_positive <- function(x){
  sum(x > 0)
}
\end{example}

Taking advantage of R vectorization of the \code{>} binary operator, this
function is as good as it gets. We will see later that this vectorization
comes at a steep price in terms of memory and time, both impacting the
performance, but for now let's concentrate on the basics and
rewrite the function using a simple for loop over elements of a
\code{NumericVector}.

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  int n = x.size(), res = 0 ;
  for( int i=0; i<n; i++) if( x[i] > 0.0 ) res++ ;
  return res ;
}
\end{example}

While the R version had to allocate memory for a temporary logical
vector, traverse the input data to fill this temporary object, then
traverse this temporary logical vector to sum the values equal to \code{TRUE},
the C++ version is essentially a simple for loop.

\section{Range based for loops}

The previous code chunk uses a typical C++ \code{for} loop, directly
inherited from C. C++11 introduces range based for loops, which have
closer semantics to the loop we would use in R, usually known as
for/each loops. We can revisit the example using a range based for loop:

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  int res = 0 ;
  for( double d: x){
    if( d > 0 ) res++ ;
  }
  return res ;
}
\end{example}

This is possible because the \code{NumericVector} class implements
the range concept with \code{begin} and \code{end} member functions. This
\code{for} loop is simpler to read than the general C++ \code{for} loop. It is also
more efficient than a badly written general for loop. It is fairly
common to see the loop expressed as \code{for(int i=0; i<x.size(); i++)} which
will perform badly as it has to evaluate \code{x.size()} at each iteration.
Depending on the compiler's optimization aggressiveness, this might have a
dramatic impact on performance. The simpler \code{for} loop does not
have this problem as it simply processes each element in the range between
\code{begin()} and \code{end()}. It also has the advantage of
resembling the R loop, although using the semicolon instead of the \code{in} keyword
and requiring us to specify the type of the looping variable \code{d} as C++
is a strongly typed language.

\section{Lambda functions}

Given \code{NumericVector} implements the range concept, a more C++ idiomatic
way of approaching the problem is to use an algorithm from the Standard
Template Library. The \code{count\_if} that was introduced
in C++11 algorithm is a natural fit, \code{count\_if} iterates through a vector
and counts the number of times the specified predicate is true. Before C++11,
we would express the predicate using a named function that is defined
elsewhere:

\begin{example}
inline bool is_positive(double x){
  return x > 0.0 ;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return std::count_if( begin(x), end(x), is_positive ) ;
}
\end{example}

We can also use a callable object to capture some context. The
following chunk uses the \code{is\_greater} class to capture both the
intended comparison with a carefully selected name and the threshold (0.0) ;

\begin{example}
class is_greater {
public:
  is_greater( double threshold_) : threshold(threshold_){}

  inline bool operator()(double x){
    return x > threshold ;
  }

private:
  double threshold ;
}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return std::count_if( x.begin(), x.end(), is_greater(0.0) ) ;
}
\end{example}

With lambdas, C++11 offers a much nicer way to define the predicate, right at the
call place. Lambdas make the STL much more useful as it eliminates
many boiler plate code that was previously needed:

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return std::count_if( x.begin(), x.end(),
    [](double d){ return d > 0 ;}
  ) ;
}
\end{example}

The syntax might look strange and terse at first sight, but conceptually
using lambda functions in C++ is very similar to what typical R users
would do with the apply family of functions. The ability to define
functions right at the call site is what was dramatically missing in order
to make the standard template library as useful as it can be.

This gives the perfect incentive to revisit the STL and learn about some
algorithms that were introduced in C++11.

\section{Concurrency}

As described by \citep{sutter2005}, the performance free lunch is over. Processors
are no longer getting much faster. It is however becoming
increasingly common that machines are equipped with multiple core processors, or
even multiple processors. In order to make the most of these
capabilities, software must take advantage of the available hardware
concurrency, we cannot any longer sit back and wait for processors to be faster
and magically make our code faster.

Concurrency is not a new thing, C++ programmers have been writing concurrent
code for some time, what is new with C++11 is that concurrency
is officially supported by the standard, this changes everything.
Where you previously would have needed to use platform specific facilities
third party abstractions built around them, you can now take advantage
of threads, mutexes, futures and promises offered by the C++ standard
library. It makes quite a big difference for developing
R packages that ought to be distributed to repositories targeting
multiple platforms, such as CRAN.

Writing concurrent code is more work, debugging it is more difficult as we need
to watch for new sources of problems such as race conditions and deadlocks. But
if we are careful enough and only use concurrency in the right place, it can
have a great impact on performance, an impact that will scale with the
hardware capabilities.

Let's factor out the body of the function used in the previous code chunk
into a function operating on a range (\code{count\_positive\_range}),
and rewrite the \code{count\_positive} function in terms of
\code{count\_positive\_range}

\begin{example}
typedef NumericVector::iterator Iterator ;

inline int count_positive_range(Iterator begin, Iterator end){
  return std::count_if( begin, end,
    [](double d){ return d > 0 ;}
  ) ;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  return count_positive_range( x.begin(), x.end() ) ;
}
\end{example}

Thanks to inlining, both implementations are identical. The benefit of
this abstraction is that \code{count\_positive\_range} could now
operate on a smaller range. As it simplest we could count the
number of positives on the first half of the data and add it to
the count of positives from the second half.

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive(NumericVector x){
  int n = x.size() ;
  Iterator start  = x.begin() ;
  int first_half  = count_positive_range(start, start+n/2) ;
  int second_half = count_positive_range(start+n/2, x.end() ) ;

  return first_half + second_half ;
}
\end{example}

This of course does not take advantage of threading as the second
calculation has to wait for the first one to finish. Writing concurrent
code is about running these two (and potentially more up to the available
hardware concurrency) tasks in parallel in separate threads.
This section is not meant as a full reference on threading techniques
or coverage of the facilities of the standard library for writing
concurrent code as can be found in \citep{williams2012} or the
relevant chapters of \citep{Stroustrup2013}.

Here is an initial implementation using a separate thread to process
the first half of the data while the main thread process the remaining:

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive_2threads(NumericVector x){
  int n = x.size() ;
  Iterator it = x.begin() ;

  std::packaged_task<int(Iterator,Iterator)> task( &count_positive_range ) ;
  std::future<int> first_half = task.get_future() ;
  std::thread t( std::move(task), it, it+n/2 ) ;

  int second_half = count_positive_range(it+n/2, x.end() ) ;
  t.join() ;

  return first_half.get() + second_half ;
}
\end{example}

A \code{thread} itself does not return a value, so here we use it in conjunction
with a \code{packaged\_task}, which gives us a way of getting hold of the result,
as a \code{future}. In this chunk the main thread counts the positive
values in the second half of the data while the thread \code{t} is counting the
number of positives in the first half of the data. When the main thread has finished
its own work, we \code{join} the worker thread, this blocks the main thread until
the worker thread has finished, so that the value associated with the
future can correctly be retrieved.

Advanced thread management techniques are outside the scope of this
article. Let's however generalize the previous chunk by splitting the work
into several threads. We can simply use a vector of threads to run the smaller
tasks and collect the results with a vector of futures.

\begin{example}
typedef std::packaged_task<int(Iterator,Iterator)> Task ;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int count_positive_threaded(NumericVector data, int nthreads){
  int n = data.size() ;
  int chunk_size = n / nthreads ;

  std::vector<std::future<int>> futures(nthreads-1) ;
  std::vector<std::thread> threads(nthreads-1) ;

  Iterator it = data.begin() ;
  for( int i=0; i<nthreads-1; i++){
    count_positive counter ;
    Task task(counter) ;
    futures[i] = task.get_future();
    threads[i] = std::thread( std::move(task), it, it + chunk_size ) ;
    it += chunk_size ;
  }

  int result = count_positive()(it, data.end());

  for( int i=0; i<nthreads-1; i++){
    threads[i].join() ;
    result += futures[i].get() ;
  }

  return result ;
}
\end{example}

Concurrency as its cost. First of all the code is more complicated
to write, to understand and to debug. We also must not assume that
running $N$ jobs in parallel will improve the performance by a factor
of $N$. Table~\ref{table:count} presents some benchmarks with various
data sizes (from $10^5$ to $ 10^9$) and various number of threads.
On the machine used when writing this article,
the \code{std::thread::hardware\_concurrency} function hints that 8 threads
are supported.

Timings of the pure R function correctly reflect typical issues of
vectorization, the R version has to first allocate a logical vector
as big as the input data to host the result of the comparison \code{x>0}, before
starting counting the positives in that logical vector. Allocating
memory takes time, and increases the chances of triggering garbage collection,
which also takes time.

The serial C++ version is a massive improvement over the R version. Further
improvement is given with multithreaded code. The timings also illustrate
the inherent cost of threads. When the data size is too small, using threads
actually degrades the whole performance. Arguably the problem used here
is quite simple, and different problem will exhibit different gains
induced by using threads. There is no universal rule for how to split
the work between threads, and the usual advice of actually measuring
run time instead of relying on educated guesses stands with thread code, more than
ever.

\section{Other useful additions to the standard}

TODO:
these features don't fit with the fil rouge, maybe just write a paragraph for each.

auto and decltype

constexpr

variadic templates

regular expressions

unordered maps and sets. were available in TR1, which used to be a pain. is it there, is it not there ...

\section{Rcpp11}

\CRANpkg{Rcpp} comes with a strong promise of stability and
background compatibility. While this might be a good thing in general,
these requirements put a lot of weight in the evolution scale of the
underlying C++ library. Embracing C++11 has greatly simplified the internal
implementation of \CRANpkg{Rcpp11}, and divorcing this implementation from
\CRANpkg{Rcpp} allows us to undo previous errors in design that had crept into
\CRANpkg{Rcpp}.

\subsection{Implementation Improvements}

no more datetime classes
header only
etc...

\subsection{Variadic Templates}

In particular, the use of \textbf{variadic templates} has allowed the removal
of auto-generated code bloat present in \CRANpkg{Rcpp}. Such code bloat was
necessary in order to support methods taking variable numbers of arguments
(analogous to an R function taking \ldots arguments). Variadic templates allow
us to achieve this in C++11 with a far cleaner implementation.

For example, the \texttt{Vector} classes in \CRANpkg{Rcpp} have \texttt{create}
methods, allowing a user to generate vectors like:

\begin{example}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
List make_list() {
  return List::create(
    _["a"] = 1,
    _["b"] = 2,
    _["c"] = 3
  )
}
\end{example}

However, achieving this in \CRANpkg{Rcpp} requires that a \textit{separate method} is
defined for each of the potential number of arguments that could be passed. Currently,
\CRANpkg{Rcpp}'s \texttt{create} supports up to twenty arguments passed,
requiring a lot of auto-generated code bloat (about 1200 lines of code in total).
In contrast, \CRANpkg{Rcpp11}'s create method is defined quite simply:

\begin{example}
template <typename... Args>
Vector<RTYPE, StoragePolicy> Vector<RTYPE,StoragePolicy>::create(Args... args){
  return typename create_type<RTYPE, Args...>::type( args... ) ;
}
\end{example}

This declaration defines create as a function taking a variable number of
arguments (from zero to a compiler-defined maximum). No code bloat; functions
are generated as required by the compiler when seen in user code.

A substantial portion of the code base in \CRANpkg{Rcpp} was auto-generated to
handle such situations, primarily in the modules framework -- roughly 59k lines (!)
of auto-generated code are present in the \texttt{inst/include/generated}
directory (excluding headers), which are all now unnecessary and removed from
\CRANpkg{Rcpp11}.

TODO:
Complete redesign of Rcpp.
Header only. Assumes C++11.
Much smaller (eliminated lots of code bloat).
Cleaner (got rid of some ghosts).
Threaded sugar.

\section{Beyond C++11}

During development, C++11 was called C++0x in the hope that it would have been
released some time before 2010. The changes from previous versions of C++
were important, therefore it could only be released officially in 2011. People
often say that C++11 is indeed C++0x in hexadecimal (with $x$ equal to $b$).

However, the pace of the C++ standards has dramatically increased. A new version
of the standard is expected in 2014, and is likely to be backed by at least
two major compiler suites (gcc and clang) the same year. C++14 is expected to
be a minor bug fix release.

The next major release is currently schedule for 2017. For this major
update of the standard, the committee has split the work into several
working groups, e.g. Core, Evolution, Concurrency, Modules, Reflection, to name
a few.

Although we had to wait until 2013 to see compiler fully support C++11, and
R 3.1.0 for explicit support for packages using C++11 code, things are likely
to move faster for upcoming versions of the C++ Standard.

\section{Conclusion}

Through a few simple examples, this article has reviewed a few features from
the C++11 standard through the lens of habits and needs of R programmers.
Conceptually simple features such as range based for loops and lambda functions
make C++ a language closer to R. This article also scratched the surface
of multi-threaded code using built in support from the standard library.

C++11 is still somewhat new, and it can be argued that not every platform
where R is expected to be used has access to a decent C++11 compiler. Therefore
for a package developer choosing C++11 now might entice some sacrifices. There is a
choice to be made between using a nicer language that will enable us to write
better software or conservatively stay with C++98 which is
almost universally available across the platform known to be supported by R.
While moving to C++11 comes with friction from platforms that are not equipped
with the correct tools, I would argue that staying
with C++98 also comes at a price. Indeed when starting to develop non trivial
code, we quickly want to use platform specific facilities or
third party libraries. With the addition of features such threading, hash maps and lambda
functions into the standard, C++11 is a breath of fresh air. Let's breathe.
